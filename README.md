# webspec â€” a tool to manage WebSpecs

In the Web Platform Specs project, we've taken great care to make sure things are as easy and
straightforward as possible for developers. But we can't magic absolutely *everything* away
just like that. Some aspects, like the legalese bits or some recurring technical items, remain
somewhat in the way.

However this doesn't mean we can't hide them away behind a tool! That's what `webspec` does.

At the moment, the only aspect that `webspec` supports is `webspec new`, which guides you through
the steps of building a new WebSpec by generating the few support files (`LICENSE`, etc.) that are
required but you don't want to know about.
